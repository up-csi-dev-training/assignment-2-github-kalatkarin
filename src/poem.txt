AGAIN? AGAIN!
by Xdinary Heroes (my fav band!!)

It’s real this time, it’s my first
With confidence, shout out to my last

Oh, here again, here again, beat again
I feel again, beat again, crushed again

One day you fell into my heart
My last day love story that somehow started
Somebody help me please, I think I'll never change
I don't want to repeat the same ________
It's so sweet, I've already forgotten it, falling, falling down without any resistance

TBH, I'm afraid, a love that only left _______
Please no more, I didn't want to do it anymore
Show me how not to fall for you
If I can avoid it, I will

Oh my gosh, it's Dami fromDreamcatcher!
I didn't know that I could feel the love again
Crush again, it's my first time seeing someone like you, it's love again
Blow me up, blow me up like _______
Want you bad, want you bad, please don't say no
It spreads uncontrollably
